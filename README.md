The problem we decided to tackle was predciting League of Legends esports matches after 10 minutes of play. The tasks included in the project were acquiring the data, cleaning the data, coding the model, and then running CV-model and determining the best classifier. In my capacity as a team member, I located the data set, wrote the code importing it into Google Colab, wrote the regex method to clean the data, delegated the different tasks to the team, and then integrated the group's code block into the finished project file. We were able to sucessfully predict the outcome of professional League of Legends matches after 10 minutes with a 66% accuracy using GaussianNB with Naive priors [0.5,0.5] priors.
